# MapIt

Purpose: 
Map It is an interactive geography game developed for HackMIT 2020. The purpose of Map It is to provide a fun and educational way for students to learn geography. 

Instructions for Use: 
In order to run the program, simply run "run.py" and navigate to "localhost:5000" in the web browser. The webapp displays a random state and the user must guess the location of the state by clicking on it on the map. If he or she guesses correctly, the state changes color and a new state is prompted. The user has unlimmited tries to guess the location of a state. The user wins when he or she successfully guesses all 50 states on the map. The webapp records how long it takes for the user to win and includes a progress bar. 

Developmental Process:
We created a web app using HTML/CSS/Javascript. Our biggest hurdle was figuring out how to create an interactive map. We ended up splitting off into two groups, one of which who tried to make the map from scratch (buttons on top of a blank map image), and the other who tried to implement an online solution (found in the sources section). In the end, we decided to go with the online solution since it would have been very time consuming to make the map from scratch.

The original github repo for our map is located here: https://github.com/robflaherty/us-map-raphael

Future Directions: 
In order to make Map It even better than it currently is, we would want to implement some potential features such as, a leaderboard, different maps, a login system, and a type-in mode for guessing states for even better learning!
